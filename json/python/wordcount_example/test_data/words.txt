south
stoneham
house
was
acquired
with
south
hill
situated
some
two
miles
northwest
of
wessex
lane
in
to
house
male
students
at
university
college
southampton
it
was
originally
the
manor
house
of
the
parish
of
south
stoneham
which
stretched
along
the
river
itchen
from
the
bargate
in
southampton
city
centre
to
eastleigh
the
house
itself
was
constructed
in
as
the
family
home
of
edmund
dummer
the
former
surveyor
of
the
navy
and
has
been
attributed
to
nicholas
hawksmoor
while
its
gardens
were
laid
out
after
by
capability
brown
though
very
little
of
the
original
landscaping
remains
tradition
prevailed
in
the
house
with
a
collegiate
atmosphere
as
gowns
were
expected
to
be
worn
to
dinner
and
lectures
and
curfews
were
enforced
the
south
stoneham
regime
was
also
distinctly
paternalistic
a
bell
was
rung
at
each
evening
and
everyone
settled
in
silence
to
study
until
another
bell
two
hours
later
released
us
for
dinner
at
o'clock
another
bell
called
us
to
prayers
half
an
hour
later
the
warden
came
round
to
all
the
bedrooms
to
check
that
everyone
was
in
bed
ernest
holmes
the
university
of
southampton
an
illustrated
history
by
there
was
distinct
pressure
on
space
in
the
halls
of
residence
and
it
was
clear
that
more
rooms
were
needed
the
existing
halls
were
full
and
so
south
stoneham
and
south
hill
were
extended
by
covering
their
outbuildings
during
the
second
world
war
the
highfield
location
of
the
college
meant
it
was
directly
in
the
war
zone
itself
with
southampton
being
attacked
the
halls
of
residence
were
also
under
siege:
at
south
stoneham
windows
were
blown
in
by
bombs
for
much
of
this
time
the
college
operated
a
school
of
navigation
based
in
the
communal
rooms
of
stoneham
house
in
a
concrete
tower
extension
was
added
to
the
hall
incorporating
a
bar
and
dining
hall
area
both
now
out
of
use
the
extension
was
designed
as
a
stop-gap
measure
until
the
full
development
of
the
montefiore
and
glen
eyre
sites
could
be
pushed
through
with
an
anticipated
lifespan
of
just
years
over
four
decades
on
the
tower
was
only
finally
removed
from
the
university
housing
stock
in
south
stoneham
has
rooms
over
its
floors
of
which
are
residential
although
it
is
all
closed
to
the
public
for
the
majority
of
stoneham
existence
as
a
residence
students
were
fully
catered
for
in
the
building
own
canteen
and
dining
hall
in
latter
years
as
the
building
use
was
wound
down
residents
were
part-catered
for
and
ate
in
connaught
galley
restaurant
residents
shared
small
kitchen
and
bathroom
facilities
much
controversy
had
surrounded
the
continuous
use
of
south
stoneham
tower
and
in
a
large
wooden
collar
was
added
to
the
base
of
the
tower
to
prevent
crumbling
concrete
falling
onto
staff
and
students
below
as
the
tower
was
originally
built
using
asbestos
its
decommission
and
deconstruction
has
provided
a
technical
stumbling
block
to
redevelopment
of
the
south
stoneham
site
physical
disassembly
would
be
hugely
expensive
while
explosives
cannot
be
used
due
to
the
proximity
of
private
houses
and
the
grade
ii
listed
south
stoneham
house
the
future
of
stoneham
tower
is
uncertain
though
it
will
not
be
used
for
accommodation
again
due
to
it
being
deemed
unsafe
in
